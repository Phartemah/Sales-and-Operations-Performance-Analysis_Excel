I worked on transforming WorkNest Suppliesâ€™ raw dataset from messy to meaningful business insights. The process includes understanding the business problems, stakeholders needs and asking follow up questions, studying the dataset, data cleaning, creating calculated business metrics, performing analysis to uncover insights using pivot tables and data visualization.

## Business Problem
The management needed visibility into their revenue and operation performance from their raw data. They want to have an idea on the impact of discounts and shipping efficiency as well as have a visual report of KPIs across regions, customers, and product segments.<a href="https://github.com/Phartemah/Sales-and-Operations-Performance-Analysis_Excel/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-10-26%20at%2000.44.51.png">View Dashboard</a>
